# hacker-news-favorites-api

A simple script that will scrape the favorites for a provided hacker news user id.

[Before](https://news.ycombinator.com/favorites?id=sbr464) ‚á® [After](https://reactual.api.stdlib.com/hnfavs/?id=sbr464&limit=1) üëç

## Why?

The official Hacker News API from Y Combinator doesn't include the favorites endpoint. I use favorites like bookmarks and wanted to sync them to another app.

## Usage

You can run yourself, or use the api endpoint hosted at the below url. Be sure to pass the query params mentioned below.

##### Base Endpoint:

`https://reactual.api.stdlib.com/hnfavs/`

##### Example URL:

This example would download 1 page of 30 favorites for the user `sbr464`

`https://reactual.api.stdlib.com/hnfavs/?id=sbr464&limit=1`

---

Accepts 3 query params, only `id` is required.

#### id

_required_ | `string` | default='' | The Hacker News username.

#### limit

_optional_ | `number` | default=1 | Max # of pages to download (30/page).

#### offset

_optional_ | `number` | default=1 (none) | Pagination offset, the page to begin on.

---

## Data Format

The API will return a JSON object-array containg the favorites as below. You can use the article id to obtain more info via the [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API). There is more info (comments link, score) avail to scrape from favorites, but the HN API is more reliable.

```js
;[
  {
    // HN article id
    id: '17437185',

    // Article's direct url (not comments)
    link: 'https://github.com/serhii-londar/open-source-mac-os-apps',

    // Title of the article on HN
    title: 'Awesome macOS open source applications'
  }
]
```

## Notes

Currently, the request timeout is manually set to just under 3 minutes, but could change. You may need to provide an offset and make multiple requests if you are getting a timeout when trying to download hundreds-thousands+ of favorites. If you receive a timeout error, modify the limit/offset and retry the request. We are using [stdlib](https://stdlib.com/) to host the api.

## More Info

Additional docs & a live testing tool avail at [stdlib](https://stdlib.com/@reactual/lib/hnfavs/).

## Installation via npm

Recently published as `hnfavs` on npm, have only done basic testing.
`x-ray` is a required peer dependency, you'll need to add to your project.

```sh
npm install --save hnfavs x-ray

yarn add hnfavs x-ray
```

```js
// Basic usage
const hnfavs = require('hnfavs')

hnfavs('sbr464').then(console.log)
```

## Local Installation

It's a node.js app, using [x-ray](https://github.com/matthewmueller/x-ray) for the web scraping. See `src/main.test.js` for example usage locally.

```sh
# Clone repo
$ git clone git@github.com:reactual/hacker-news-favorites-api.git

$ cd hacker-news-favorites-api

# Install with yarn or npm
